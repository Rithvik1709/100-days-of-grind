# 100 Days of DSA: From Beginner to Expert

Welcome to the **100 Days of DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** challenge! This README will guide you through the plan, tools, and resources to transform your problem-solving skills and DSA knowledge from beginner to expert level.
---

## Daily Plan
### Example Daily Schedule:
1. **30 minutes**: Learn a concept (e.g., Array Traversals, Binary Search).
2. **60-90 minutes**: Solve problems on that topic from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, or HackerRank.
3. **10 minutes**: Reflect and document your learnings.
