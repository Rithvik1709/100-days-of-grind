Title: Reinforcement Learning Basics with Q-Learning
ðŸš€ Objective:
To understand the foundational concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and implement a basic Q-learning algorithm in a grid-based environment.

ðŸ§  Key Concepts:
Agent: Learner or decision maker.
Environment: Where the agent interacts.
State: Current situation of the agent.
Action: Possible moves the agent can take.
Reward: Feedback from the environment.
Policy: Strategy that maps states to actions.
Q-Table: Stores the expected future rewards for actions in each state.
ðŸ”§ What We Did:
Created a simple 4x4 GridWorld.
Used Q-Learning to train an agent to reach the goal.
Visualized the learned policy after training.
ðŸŽ¯ Why Itâ€™s Important:
Reinforcement Learning is behind many advanced applications like:

Game-playing agents (e.g., AlphaGo)
Robotics
Autonomous vehicles
Recommender systems
Understanding Q-Learning builds your foundation for more complex algorithms like Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Policy Gradient methods.
